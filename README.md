# Missing_People_Chrome_Extension

Version: 1.0
Manifest Version: 2 (doesn't yet work on version 3 because I can't directly manipulate network requests in real-time)

## Description:

This is a simple Chrome extension that redirects you to https://www.izdirvane.com/persons
whenever you encounter a 404 Not Found ERROR in a website.

The above mentioned website is an unofficial registry for missing people in Bulgaria.
The extension provides users with information about missing persons to raise awareness and potentially aid in locating them. This is a topic I take very seriously and one that's very close to my heart.

## Usage:

* Install the extension by loading it as an unpacked extension in Google Chrome.
* Once installed, the extension automatically activates and begins monitoring web requests.
* If a 404 error occurs while browsing, the extension redirects the user to the designated website to learn more about missing persons.
